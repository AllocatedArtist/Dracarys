# Dracarys
C99 Game Library 

What is it?

Dracarys aims to provide a simple and easy to use library for game development. It is my personal project to make my "perfect tool" for making games, and is therefore not meant to be the universal perfect library for everyone's use. Dracarys is a learning project, an attempt to make custom tools. But it will rely on third parties where it might need to, and it should never be too reliant on itself. This means that if my custom implementation isn't good enough, it can easily be swapped. Dracarys needs to be low level enough for my needs of learning, and it should serve as a base for creating higher level components. It should include higher level components like model loading, and physics, but it will be minimal since these kinds of things might work better if implemented in the actual game. Dracarys is the game library I want to use for all my projects, the same way I might use raylib, monogame, or miniquad.
